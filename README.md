# :desktop_computer: REST API Project

I built this project for an assignment as part of a Full Stack Web Development course I study at the HackerU College.
With all my love for a client-side projects, this entire project is based on server side only.

## About the project and what it does?
You can register (or log-in) in the database and create a business card for your business. You can create as many cards as you want.
You can also `CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE` all your cards (CRUD)

## Installation
*Be sure to download all modules needed for this project*. To do this, write the following code in the terminal:

```
npm i  
```


In addition, a file called `.env` is missing for the security reasons.
You need to add this file and insert the following variables enviorment:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT = // PORT Number
db = // DataBase Connection String URI Format
secretKey = // Some String
```
